            <h6>Riverstone </h6>
            <p>Slightly less frequented by mainstream tourists, this location is roughly 30 kilometers from Matale town along the Matale-Girandurukotte route. It is windy and has several hairpin twists, but overall is in decent shape. It offers breathtaking views from all directions and feels like a little version of the world's end. Thelgamu Oya provides a great location for a dip in the chilly but crystal clear water, and the climate here is very similar to that of the Horton Plains. There are two magnificent waterfalls, "Sera Ella" and "Bambarakiri Ella," which are both sights to behold. Don't forget to unwind on the rock seats of "Sera Ella," savoring the cool misty spray of water on your face.
                
                 It's safe to say that continuing upstream on this gorgeous stream will revitalize and revive you. Planning a trekking trip to the mist-clad Riverston peak (02.5 km) via Pittawala Pathana is highly recommended as it provides some of the best views of the central hills across the mini world's end, which ends in a sheer drop of 300 meters offering a great vista, particularly of the “Knuckles range” and the Thelgamu valley below with its terraced paddy field method that is exclusive to Sri Lanka's central hills.
