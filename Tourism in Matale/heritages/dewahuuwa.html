            <p>On the Adiagala road from Galewela. m. When you travel for 7.5 km, you will find this reservoir near the Belyakanda junction. You can even take a bath in a safe place here, which is a beautiful body of water. It is said that the word Devahuwa was formed by combining the two words Diyahuwa. This reservoir located in Matale district supplies water to the paddies of Anuradhapura district.

In the year 1950, the restoration of the old lake has been made into a larger reservoir. At that time, bricks belonging to the Anuradhupara period were used to build the ancient castle, and the tank and a part of the old tank wall were found. Legend has it that the ancient lake here was built by King Dutugemunu, who discovered this land when he was going to Malaya from Anuradhapura. Today, this lake, which is also fed by Mahaweli water, was first built by taking water from Kudo Oya and Kalugal Oya
